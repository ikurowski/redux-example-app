# Redux Example App

This example application demonstrates the use of Redux with several advanced features, including asynchronous actions using the redux-thunk middleware, REST API calls with axios to both GET and PUT data, integration with Firebase for real-time updates, and Material-UI for styling.

I hope this app is useful to you! Feel free to fork the repository and customize it to fit your needs.
